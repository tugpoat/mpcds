mpcDS v0.2.1, 2012 Pat Murphy
Uses modified graphics from an old PALib mpd client.

0.1: First public release
0.2: complete code restructuring, more modular and much less messy
0.2.1:
-Removed client-side host states for playing, paused and stopped as they sometimes caused sync issues
-Added some comments to explain some of my laziness in this project ;)

COMPILING:
	-Use Makefile.ds.release.
	-If you want to test in an emulator, use Makefile.emu.ideas, or write your own emulator-specific makefile.
